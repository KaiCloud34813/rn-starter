# rn-starter
As I'm learning React Native which is mainly for mobile apps, I'm building an application as long as I am learning many interesting concepts like hooks and react-native specific syntax.
To run this project:

### Clone my repository
### run: npm install --legacy-peer-deps {some packages may be old or deprecated so this option forces somehow the installation}
### run: npm start {if it doesn't work, run npm start -- --offline}, you'll have multiple options (make sure you install expo on your physical device or emulator)

Happy learning!!
